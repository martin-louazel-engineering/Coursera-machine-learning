# Coursera-machine-learning
Completed exercices of the Coursera Machine Learning Courses

The exercices presented is this repository are the result of finishing the Coursera course on Machine Learning.
The course was conducted by Prof. Andrew Ng. of the University of Standford.
Out of the 11 weeks of courses, 8 of them ended with an approx. 3 hours coding practical cases to apply this weeks topic into Matlab code.
The exercices covered different types of machine learning techniques, including :
-Linear/Logistic Regression
-Support Vector Machine
-Neural Network
-Clustering Algorithm
-Principal Component Analysis
-Anomaly detection

For each exercice, the instructions are given in the corresponding "exX.pdf" file.
Inside each folder, the file "exX.m" worked as the gideline for the entire exercice, with results being used on datasets then plotted. The other .m files were completed progressively throughout the exercice to answer the several instructions to be then used in the main "exX.m" file.

These solutions were all accepted when submitted. Some optionnal work may be missing.
Please note that these solutions were the fruit of my own reflections and efforts.
PLEASE REFRAIN FROM USING THEM TO COMPLETE THE COURSE.
